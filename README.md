Write a program to simulate the actions of a phonebook only using arrays.
This application is targeted at showcasing my ability to use only arrays as my data structure to complete this assignment.

## Requirements 

- __Operate on the console__

  - Add new entries 
  -	Search for an existing entry
  -	Search by first name *
  -	Search by last name *
  -	Search by full name *note name is not unique therefore the result should be an array of Person Objects.
  -	Search by telephone number
  -	Search by city or state
  -	Delete a record for a given telephone number
  -	Update a record for a given telephone number
  -	Show all records in asc order *note you will need to research sorting on an array.
  -	An option to exit the program 

## Testing

- __Test cases__

  - John Doe, 114 Market St, St Louis, MO, 63403, 6366435698
  - John E Doe, 324 Main St, St Charles, MO,63303, 8475390126
  - John Michael West Doe, 574 Pole ave, St. Peters, MO, 63333, 5628592375
  
**Note: Test cases should work when copy and paste into the console as one entry (as is).

Searching for John should return a list of all 3 records above, displaying the telephone number in this order (636)-453-8563.
